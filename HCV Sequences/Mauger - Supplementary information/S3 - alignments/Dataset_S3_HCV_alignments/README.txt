HCV_alignments

This folder contains MultiFASTA alignment of clinically derived HCV sequences from publically available databases. Sequences are identified by a name that contains period-delimited identifiers such that the genotype is the first term and the relevant accession number is the last term.

For example, the sequence ">1a.US.2001.HCV-1a/US/BID-V440/2001.EU256053" is an HCV-1a isolate with the accession number EU256053. The database entry for this NCBI accession number reveals that this entry is a direct submission from the Broad Research Institute’s microbial sequencing center.

Gaps in the alignment are represented by ‘–‘ and many entries are missing sequences of the untranslated regions near the ends of the genome.
